    Parameters
    ----------
    device: torch.device
        Choose between cuda or cpu.
    model: torch.nn.Module
        A pytorch network model.
    optimizer: torch.optim.Optimizer
        A pytorch optimizer like Adam.
    criterion: torch.nn.Loss
        A pytorch criterion that defines the loss.
    trainloader: torch.utils.data.DataLoader
        Loader of train data.
